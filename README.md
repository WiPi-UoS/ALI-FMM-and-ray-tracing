# ALI-FMM-and-ray-tracing
Anisotropic Locally Interpolated Fast Marching Method (ALI-FMM) is a method for calculating 2D travel time fields for generally anisotropic media. These travel time fields can be used to find the ray paths corresponding to the first arival travel time.

Codes for running ALI-FMM and ray tracing for anisotropic materials including the Python module, Jupyter notebook and weld example. Documentation of the module is provded at https://wipi-uos.github.io/ALI-FMM-and-ray-tracing/.
